## <span style="color: #0073e6;">Project Objective</span>

This project focuses on developing an AI-powered system to optimize hospital triage processes. The system prioritizes cases using advanced deep analytics and AI, helping hospitals manage limited resources effectively. By improving patient prioritization and streamlining triage, this solution addresses the challenges faced by overburdened hospitals, particularly during critical conditions like COVID-19 or pneumonia outbreaks.

  <h3>Key Features</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>AI-Driven Triage:</strong> Automatically prioritize patients based on symptoms and conditions like COVID-19 and pneumonia.</li>
    <li><strong>Mobile and Web Integration:</strong> Patients can report symptoms through mobile devices, and hospitals can manage triage through a web interface.</li>
    <li><strong>Resource Management:</strong> Enables hospitals to allocate resources effectively by prioritizing high-risk patients.</li>
    <li><strong>Patient Feedback Analysis:</strong> Gathers patient feedback to analyze satisfaction and optimize hospital operations.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

## <span style="color: #0073e6;">Technologies Used</span>

<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
  <li><strong>Oracle Database 19c:</strong> Backend database for storing patient, hospital, and triage data.</li>
  <li><strong>PL/SQL:</strong> Used for stored procedures, triggers, and auditing functions.</li>
  <li><strong>SQL Developer:</strong> Tool for developing and managing the Oracle database system.</li>
  <li><strong>Artificial Intelligence Models:</strong> Used to analyze medical images for disease detection.</li>
  <li><strong>Java:</strong> Back-end services for mobile and web-based hospital management integration.</li>
</ul>

## <span style="color: #0073e6;">Challenges Faced</span>

<div style="border: 1px solid #f0ad4e; padding: 10px;">
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Data Consistency:</strong> Ensuring that the triage process remains consistent across mobile and web platforms while maintaining data integrity.</li>
    <li><strong>AI Model Integration:</strong> Incorporating AI for real-time analysis of patient symptoms and medical images to ensure quick triage decisions.</li>
    <li><strong>Efficient Resource Allocation:</strong> Balancing patient needs and hospital capacity during high-demand periods like pandemics.</li>
  </ul>
